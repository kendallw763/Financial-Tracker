## âœ¨ Features
Manage Transactions & Data â€“ Store, track, and manipulate numeric and textual data such as amounts, dates, and descriptions.

Automate Logic & Decisions â€“ Apply conditions and loops to validate transactions, categorize entries, and calculate totals automatically.

Reusable Functions & Methods â€“ Encapsulate common operations like adding, updating, or deleting transactions to reduce repetition and errors.

Organize Collections of Data â€“ Use lists, dictionaries, and sets to efficiently group, search, and retrieve transactions.

Structure the Application with Classes â€“ Model real-world entities like Transaction with properties and behaviors, enabling scalable and maintainable code.

Define Fixed Choices & Abstract Behavior â€“ Enforce categories, transaction types, and shared rules across all transactions to maintain consistency.

Persist Data with File/Database I/O â€“ Read and write transaction records to SQLite, ensuring data is stored and retrievable across sessions.

Handle Multiple Operations Smoothly â€“ Use threads or asynchronous processing to manage simultaneous requests without blocking the application.

Integrate External Data Sources â€“ Fetch or send financial data through APIs for enhanced functionality, such as currency rates or transaction verification.
